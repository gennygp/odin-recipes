# odin-recipes

This project is an assignment from the Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/).

The assignment was to build a basic recipe website that consisted of a few recipes.

This project helped me get more familiar with Github. It also helped me practice some basic Git commands and building a website from scratch.

Recipes and images were sourced from https://www.allrecipes.com/.
