        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="description">
          This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy edges.
          Don't use meat that is leaner than 80/20 for best results, and make
          sure the meat is very cold. I prefer to cook these outdoors to avoid
          smoking up the kitchen. These grill up very fast because of the high
          heat, so make sure you have everything ready to go!
        </p>

        <h2 class="recipe">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>4 hamburger buns</li>

          <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</li>

          <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>

          <li>4 6-inch squares parchment paper</li>

          <li>salt to taste</li>

          <li>4 slices American cheese</li>

          <li>burger toppings of choice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="recipe">Directions</h2>

        <ol class="directions">
          <li>
            Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
            Set a cast iron flat-top griddle or large cast iron skillet onto the
            grill and preheat until smoking.
          </li>

          <li>
            Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top
            until lightly browned. Set aside.
          </li>

          <li>
            Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not pack
            the meat tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly.
            Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment
            (to prevent sticking to the spatula; re-use each parchment square on
            a second patty) and immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness
            using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper
            leverage as you press down. You may also use the bottom of small
            skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt.
          </li>

          <li>
            Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the
            centers are a light pink color. Using a bench scraper or firm
            spatula, gently scrape up the patties, flip over and immediately
            cover 4 of them with cheese. Grill an additional 15 to 20 seconds;
            stack the plain patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have
            4 stacks. Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite
            toppings.
          </li>
        </ol>
